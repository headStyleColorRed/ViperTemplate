# Viper Uikit Template
This is a template that can be used to create a Viper structured component. It will create the following files:
1. Router
2. Interactor
3. Protocols
4. Router
5. ViewController
6. Storyboard

## Instalation
In order to "install" it, you have to options:
- Install it by running the following script on this template project root folder ```sh installTemplate.sh```
- Copy this whole folder to this path "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Application"

## Blue folder
Right upon the files creation, these files will be under a blue folder. So far I haven't been able to create it as a group so, the temporary solution is removing the reference and adding it back creating groups.
